<h1>What is meant by HTL??</h1>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
With HTML you can create your own Website. The latest HTML5 standard.
Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
it to display.</p>


<p>
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
between researchers.</p>

<p>
Declaration tag is used by the web browser to understand the version of
the HTML used in the document.
There are many other declaration types which can be used in HTML document depending on
what version of HTML is being used.</p>

<p>
Heading Tags
Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also
has six levels of headings by using elements available in HTML.</p>

<p>
Nested HTML Elements:</p>
<p>
It is very much allowed to keep one HTML element inside another HTML element.
</p>

<h2>Core Attributes</h2>
<p>The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all)
are:</p>
<p>
1) Id</p>
<p>
2) Title</p>
<p>
3) Class</p>
<p>
4) Style</p>
<h3>
1)The Id Attribute:</h3>
<p>
The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML
page. There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an
element:</p>
<p>
a) If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just
that element and its content.</p>
<p>
b) If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you
can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.</p>
<h3>
2)The title Attribute:</h3>
<p>
The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. They syntax for the title attribute
is similar as explained for id attribute.</p>
<p>
The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often
displayed as a tooltip when cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading.</p>
<h3>
3)The class Attribute:</h3>
<p>
The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class
of element. You will learn more about the use of the class attribute when you will learn
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). So for now you can avoid it.</p>
<p>
The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
class="className1 className2 className3".</p>
<h3>
4)The style Attribute:</h3>
<p>
The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.

<p>
HTML â€“ FORMATTING</p>
<p>
Must be familiar with the ability to make text bold, italicized,
or underlined; these are just three of the ten options available to indicate how text can appear
in HTML and XHTML.</p>
